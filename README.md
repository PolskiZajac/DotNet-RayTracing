# DotNet-RayTracing

Project is based on code from [this article](https://4programmers.net/Z_pogranicza/Raytracing/) which is licensed under [Creative Commons 3.0 BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

This project was started to learn better C#, project planing, software architecture and SOLID principles (still working on that).

### Future plans:
 - GPU support?
 - task schedudling using small squares
 - socket layer to enable scaling vertically
 - finish GUI
 - animations in JSON?
 - unit tests?
